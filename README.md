# Credit-Card-Approval-Prediction
The objective of the classification analysis is to explore the relationship between the independent variables (such as income, age, credit history, employment status, etc.) and the dependent variable (credit card approval) to build a predictive model.
The dataset contains information related to various attributes and features of credit card applications, along with a binary label indicating the approval status (approved or not approved).

üìå Tasks -

1. What is the distribution of credit card approval status in the dataset? How many applications are approved and how many are not approved?

2. Is there any relationship between the applicant's gender and credit card approval status? Can you calculate the approval rate for each gender category (male and female) and determine if there is a significant difference using a hypothesis test?

3. Are there any missing values in the dataset for variables like "Years_employed" and "Education_type"? Can you identify variables with missing data and suggest an appropriate strategy, such as imputation or removal, for handling them?

4. Can you visualize the distribution of "Total_income" for approved and not approved credit card applications using a suitable plot, such as a boxplot or histogram? Are there any noticeable differences in income between the two groups?

5. What is the most common income type and education type among the applicants? Can you create a bar plot or pie chart to visualize the distribution of income types and education types?
